    DRY principle : "Don't repeat yourself". It encourages code reusability.
    Usage : Organizes code and performs specific tasks.

Syntax :
--------

e.g. 1:
public int addition(int operand1, int operand2) {
    int sum = operand1 + operand2;
    return sum;
}

summary : 
        public   : modifier
        int      : return type
        addition : method name   

        ( operand1, operand2, ... ) => parameter-list
        
        { int sum = operand1 + operand2; return sum; } => body of the method
